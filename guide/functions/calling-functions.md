# Calling Functions

**TODO: what does it mean to call a function**

**TODO: what are arguments**

In functional programming, the language is generally built around making and calling functions. Because of this, it's important to have a clear and easy way to do this. In Aspen, to call a function, we could do:

```text
multiply 10 20
```

Let's break this down:

* `multiply` is the name of the function we're calling
* `10` and `20` are the arguments we're passing to this function

{% hint style="warning" %}
Remember to separate the arguments by a space. Also, it is generally advised to use parenthesis to show function order. For example, `multiply ( add 10 5 ) 8` is preferred over `multiply add 10 5 8`, even though they are technically the same.
