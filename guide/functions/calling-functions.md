# Calling Functions

**TODO: what does it mean to call a function**

**TODO: what are arguments**

In functional programming, the language is generally built around making and calling functions. Because of this, it's important to have a clear and easy way to do this. In Aspen, to call a function, we could do:

```text
> multiply 10 20
200
```

Let's break this down:

* `multiply` is the name of the function we're calling
* `10` and `20` are the arguments we're passing to this function
