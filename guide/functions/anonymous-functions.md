# Anonymous Functions

What if we have a function that we only need to use once. Defining a whole new function isn't always the best thing to do. 

```text
> square = x -> x * x
function : any -> any

> square 5
25 : Int

> ( x -> x * x )
anonymous function : any -> any

> ( x -> x * x ) 5
25 : Int
```

Lambda!
