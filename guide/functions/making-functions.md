# Making Functions

## Function Definition

Now that you know how to use a function, let's try making one! Making a new function is generally known as a "function definition" or "defining a function". let's try it:

```text
triangleArea = base height -> ( 1 / 2 ) * base * height
```

Let's break this down a bit:

* `name` is the name of the function we're defining
* `base` and `height` are the the arguments we pass to the function
* The arrow `->` separates the arguments from the function body

## What is the Function Body?

well, um...
