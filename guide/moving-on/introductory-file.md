-- Welcome to Aspen!
-- Aspen is a functional programming language.
-- As you might have figured out by now, this is a comment.
-- You begin a comment with two hyphens "--".
-- This will stop the compiler from reading anything after the comment,
-- until the end of the line. 
-{ 
    You can also use "-{ example comment }-" for muti-line comments.
    This will ignore everything within the braces, 
    and will not continue to the end of the line.
    -{ 
        As as with most multiline comments, they can be nested.
    }-

-- Let's make a hello world program.
-- This is trivial enough:

display "Hello, World!"

-- The function "display" is used to print something to the console.
