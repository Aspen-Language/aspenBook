# Comments

It is generally easier to write code than to read it. Because of this, quite a long time ago, someone invented comments. A comment is a way to tell the compiler that what follows is not code and it should ignore it. 

```text
-- This is a comment
```

```text
-{
    This is a comment 
    that spans multiple lines
}-
```
