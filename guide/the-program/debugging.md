# Debugging

When writing a program, it is common to make little mistakes in your code. These, for some reason, are called "bugs". When a bug occurs, it's important to track it down and fix it. This process can be a bit frustrating at times, so it's important to calm down and think through the problem instead of giving up or making random changes to the program until it works.
